Building a replacement https://belmonts-bannermen.org/

The goal is to do the entire framework via Django, using LetsEncrypt as the SSL
validation.

Further, implement an update system based off of my djangoblog for
Python230.  (Including the option for polls, because why the hell not.)

Last we will also want to incorporate the already completed 404 page and the
silly adventure game I'm working on.

I'm envisioning a structure about like this on the backend:

[bbwebsite]/
  |-[mysite]/
    |-__init.py__
    |-settings/
      |-common.py
      |-development.py
      |-__init.py__
      |-production.py
    |-urls.py
    |-wsgi.py

Followed by all stuff I'll need for the 404 and the game.

Also, probably need to touch base with the Belmont kids and see what features
they'd want.  Maybe a twitch window or something, dunno.  At the least, should
be good for a night out for beer.
